## Usage

To see this application in action click this link: 

To use this application the user must first login using the username and password that we have provided. The username is: (user1) and the password is (password123). Once the user is logged in, they will be redirected to the appointments page which will show a calendar with existing appointments. When the user clicks on one of the existing appointments they will be redirected to an existing appointment page which will show the details of the appointment and allow the user to either make changes and save them by clicking the update button, or delete the appointment by clicking the remove button. There is also a navbar that the user can use to navigate between the different pages. Clicking on appointments will direct them back to the main page, clicking new appointment will take them to the register page where they can enter information for a new patient to create a new appointment, and clicking logout will log them out and direct them back to the login page.
